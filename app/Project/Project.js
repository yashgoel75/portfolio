                exists before sending any transaction. You can also check your
                wallet balance at any time, and for added security, Walbo
                automatically logs you out when MetaMask is disconnected.
                <br></br>You can view your complete transaction history,
                including incoming payments if the recipient is also a Walbo

                searchable logs. For a more comfortable user experience, Walbo
                also supports dark mode.
